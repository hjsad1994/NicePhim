# Video Player State Update Issue

## Problem Description
The video player quality and speed selection buttons are not updating their display text when options are selected from the dropdown menus.

## Current Behavior
- **Quality Button**: Always shows "1080p" regardless of selection
- **Speed Button**: Always shows "1x" regardless of selection
- **Dropdown Menus**: Open and close correctly
- **Console Logs**: State updates are being called and logged correctly

## Expected Behavior
- **Quality Button**: Should display selected quality (360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p)
- **Speed Button**: Should display selected speed (0.5x, 0.75x, 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 2x)

## Technical Details

### State Management
```typescript
const [currentQuality, setCurrentQuality] = useState('1080p');
const [playbackRate, setPlaybackRate] = useState(1);
```

### Event Handlers
```typescript
const handleQualityChange = (quality: string) => {
  console.log('Before quality change:', currentQuality);
  setCurrentQuality(quality);
  setShowQualityMenu(false);
  console.log('After quality change:', quality);
};

const handlePlaybackRateChange = (rate: number) => {
  const video = videoRef.current;
  if (!video) return;
  
  console.log('Before speed change:', playbackRate);
  video.playbackRate = rate;
  setPlaybackRate(rate);
  setShowSpeedMenu(false);
  console.log('After speed change:', rate);
};
```

### UI Rendering
```typescript
// Quality Button
<span key={currentQuality} className="text-xs font-medium">{currentQuality}</span>

// Speed Button  
<span key={playbackRate} className="text-xs font-medium">{playbackRate}x</span>
```

## Debugging Attempts

### 1. Event Propagation
- Added `e.stopPropagation()` to button click handlers
- Ensured proper event handling

### 2. State Updates
- Added console.log statements to track state changes
- State updates are being called correctly
- Console shows correct values being set

### 3. React Re-rendering
- Added `key` props to force re-render
- Added `useEffect` hooks to monitor state changes
- State changes are logged but UI doesn't update

### 4. Event Handling
- Separated quality and speed menus
- Added proper click outside handling
- Ensured menu state management

## Possible Causes

### 1. React State Batching
- React might be batching state updates
- State updates might not trigger re-render

### 2. Component Re-rendering Issue
- Component might not be re-rendering when state changes
- Key props might not be working as expected

### 3. Event Handler Issues
- Event handlers might not be properly bound
- State updates might be overridden

### 4. CSS/Styling Issues
- Text might be updating but not visible due to CSS
- Z-index or positioning issues

## Next Steps for Debugging

### 1. Force Re-render
- Try using `useState` with functional updates
- Add `useCallback` for event handlers
- Use `useMemo` for computed values

### 2. Component Structure
- Check if component is properly wrapped
- Verify state is being passed correctly
- Ensure proper component lifecycle

### 3. Event Handling
- Verify event handlers are properly attached
- Check for event conflicts
- Ensure proper event propagation

### 4. State Management
- Try using `useReducer` instead of `useState`
- Add state validation
- Implement proper state logging
