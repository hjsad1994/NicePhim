## Current Focus
1. **Backend Integration**: Getting backend running to show real database data
2. **Movie Detail Pages**: Ensuring all movie links work with proper routing
3. **Real Data Display**: Replacing fallback data with actual database content
4. **Admin Workflow**: End-to-end content management workflow validation
5. **User Experience**: Enhanced admin interface with comprehensive CRUD operations

## Next Steps
1. **Start Backend Server**: Use start-backend.sh script to get database data
2. **Create Real Movies**: Add movies via admin panel with proper genres
3. **Test Movie Routing**: Verify all movie detail pages work correctly
4. **Replace Fallback Data**: Ensure frontend uses database data instead of fallback
5. Test complete movie editing and genre assignment workflow
6. Add bulk genre operations for multiple movies
7. Enhance admin dashboard with usage statistics
8. Add proper session management (JWT tokens or secure sessions)
9. Create user profile management interface
10. Implement advanced search and filtering for movies and genres

## Technical Decisions
- Using existing Spring Boot authentication structure
- Implementing client-side validation with server-side backup
- Using TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Following existing UI patterns from the codebase
- **Login supports both username and email** for flexibility
- **Genre management follows MVC pattern** with Controller, Service, Repository layers
- **Enhanced error handling** with warning vs error classification for better UX
- **UUID-based primary keys** for all entities including genres
- **Movie editing interface** with comprehensive form validation and genre assignment
- **Genre-movie relationship management** with visual indicators and modal selection
- **Hybrid Genre Loading**: Frontend uses embedded genres from MovieResponse with fallback to separate API calls
- **Debug Logging**: Added console logging to track genre data flow from backend to frontend
- **Next.js 15 Compatibility**: Using React.use() to unwrap params Promise for movie detail pages
- **Robust Fallback System**: Multiple fallback layers ensure movie detail pages always show content
- **Real Data Integration**: Fallback movies use realistic data (Spider-Man, Squid Game) with proper genres
